## Overview

This repository contains a small experiment comparing **two AI models**—Gemini 3 Pro and ChatGPT-5—on the same **interactive front-end web development task**.  

The goal:  
- Compare **code generation speed**, **lines of code**, **style**, and **creativity**.  
- Explore each AI model’s “developer personality” in practice.

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index_gemini.html` | Gemini 3 Pro output: structured, verbose, polished, with full comments and accessibility features. |
| `index_gpt5chat.html` | ChatGPT-5 output: fast, minimal, expressive prototype with interactive AI/Human panels. |

## Features

- Split-screen layout: **Human Creativity** vs **AI Creativity**  
- Single-file HTML, CSS, and JS (no external dependencies)  
- Interactive features: mouse-tracking random shapes (Human) & procedural grid (AI)  
- Light/Dark mode toggle  
- Accessibility and semantic HTML  
- Console logs for performance and interaction tracking  
- Hidden Easter egg for exploration

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blueything/AI-Code-Comparison.git

2. Open the files in a browser:

-index_gemini.html
-index_gpt5chat.html

3. Interact with each panel to see differences in AI behavior.

## Observations

Gemini 3 Pro: slower, structured, production-ready, more verbose

ChatGPT-5: fast, minimal, prototype-ready, playful UI

Both approaches highlight different strengths and trade-offs for developers.
